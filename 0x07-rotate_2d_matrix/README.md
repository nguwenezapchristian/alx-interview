# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The goal is to modify the matrix directly without using additional space.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding matrix representation in Python.
- Performing in-place operations to minimize space complexity.
- Transposing a matrix.
- Reversing rows in a matrix.
- Using nested loops for matrix manipulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.10
- SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
- No additional modules should be imported.

## Usage
To run the program, execute the following steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8.10 installed.
2. Make the main file executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x main_0.py
    ```
3. Run the test script:
    ```bash
    ./main_0.py
    ```

## Example
Given the matrix:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
